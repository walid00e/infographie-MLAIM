some shit is going on again they said...
not knowing what is going on in my life
just breathing and not living 
shit this is not cool to say the least
school is going fast and catching up is far from reality
talking a lot and having fun wont make the cut
need to build habits, read the fucking book again
violence is not even a solution
music fucked me up even more
covering the symptums and not solving the problem
fuck you dude
